This folder contains the compatibility
packages. You can import them by hand BUT
it is recommended that you instead use
the automatic import via:
Tools > Settings Generator > Debug > Import Fixes

> SettingsGeneratorHDRP
  Materials and example scenes for
  HDRP pipeline.
  
> SettingsGeneratorURP
  Materials and example scenes for
  URP pipeline.
  
> SettingsGeneratorUIToolkitPackage
  UI Toolkit assets for Unity <= 2021.1
  
> SettingsGeneratorUIToolkitModule
  UI Toolkit assets for Unity >= 2021.2
  This is probably the one you want.
