This editor window imports linear conversations from an Excel file into a dialogue database.


SETUP:
------
1. Download Unity-QuickSheet: https://github.com/kimsama/Unity-QuickSheet
To download, open that URL. Click the green Code button and click the Download button.
After downloading, unzip the ZIP file.

2. Then put the "Quick Sheet" folder and "Quick Sheet.meta" files somewhere in your 
project's Assets folder, such as in Assets / Dialogue System Extras / Excel Conversation Importer.
You can ignore the other files and folders found in the ZIP file if you like.

3. Unity 2020+ includes a built-in package that conflicts with UnityQuickSheet's GDataPlugin. 
To get UnityQuickSheet and the Excel Conversation Importer to work with Unity 2020+, after 
adding the Quick Sheet folder to your project, delete the subfolder named "GDataPlugin".
In Unity 2019 and older, you can skip this step.

4. Then select menu item Tools → Pixel Crushers → Dialogue System → Import → Excel.


FORMATTING YOUR FILES:
----------------------
The Excel file should have one conversation per worksheet, where the first column is the Actor
and the second column is the Text.

The first row is ignored. You can use it for notes describing the conversation, or for headers
"Actor" and "Dialogue Text".

By default, each conversation's title will be the same as its worksheet name.
If you want to specify a different title (for example, to include forward slashes, which
Excel doesn't support in worksheet names), tick the importer's Second Row Is Title checkbox.
Then, in the second row, set column A2 to "Conversation" and column B2 to the title.


EXAMPLE FILES:
--------------
The Examples folder contains two Excel files:

- Hello1.xlsx: Importable when Second Row Is Title is UNticked.
- Hello2.xlsx: Importable when Second Row Is Title is ticked.
